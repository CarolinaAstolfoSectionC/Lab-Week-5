This is a Music Themed website.
The design was based on the example given in class.
The color scheme is inspired by Carnaval. The festival is happening this week in my home city.
I wanted to swap images on hover on the Best of Ax√© section. I tried a few different things, but nothing was quite what I was looking for. Professor Gabriel had to help me with it. My poor css organization was the main issue.
My navigation bar is only sticky until the nav section ends.
I need to choose non copyright images.
I used Spotify's own embed function because of copyright.
